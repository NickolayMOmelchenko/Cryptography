# Caesar Cipher Solver**

This Python program is designed to decode Caesar ciphers. A Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This program takes a Caesar cipher as input and attempts to decode it, providing the correlation score, shift value, and cleartext.

## Usage:

1. Run the program using Python.

```shell
python caesar_cipher_solver.py
```

2. Input the Caesar cipher string when prompted.

3. The program will analyze the input cipher and provide the correlation score, shift value, and cleartext as output.

**Example:**

Let's test the program with the cipher: "Bdb lw zrunv"

Input:
```shell
Input the Caesar cipher string: Bdb lw zrunv
```

Output:
```shell
Correlation: 0.08594370396808874 (Shift: 7) Cleartext: yay it works
```
